Problem Statement:
Recently  at  a  University,  there  has  been  a  huge  increase  in  the  number  of  enrollments.  All 
records of students are entered into a flat file by the registrar when the students register and 
updated accordingly if there is a need. As a result of increase in enrollments, this file now has 
a lot of records. Hence the statistical officers are now finding a hard time analyzing this file to 
produce  various  reports  for  the  management.  You  are  required  write  a  program  which  will 
read in this file and produce various reports as outlined. 

This is an assignment question from a previous unit that I took in university. I modified the specifications.

I have used the Java language primarily for this assignment.
I made use of arrayLists, functions in java.
This project also sees the use of File I/O.
